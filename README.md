# Flip
Trial project for Flip Energy with Ben Larralde


## Team Members:
- Erik Edmonds
- Benjamin Larralde

## Cofounder Trial Project Plan
### Description
The trial project is designed to flesh out the base framework for a mobile application for a Flip, to allow users to sell overflow of energy back to the grid with minimal effort.

### Start Date
6/10/23

### End Date
6/24/23

### Goals
The goal of the project is to create the front end of an Android application, which will mimic the mockups as closely as possible. Functionality will be added if possible, but the back end will only have connections for future addition of battery APIs.

### Commitment
We will commit between 20-40 hours per week.

### Ownership
At the end of the trial, should we decide to part ways, Erik can decide to take the software with him or assign ownership to Flip Energy, Inc.
